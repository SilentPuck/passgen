## 🧾 Identity Statement

I am **SilentPuck**, creator of `passgen`, a password generator designed for the privacy-conscious.

This binary contains **no telemetry**, **no tracking**, and **no network activity**.  
There are no backdoors, no analytics, and no cloud-based build systems.  
All code is written manually in C, compiled locally on a clean Fedora system, and released as a static binary.

The `passgen` binary does not connect to the internet, does not read user data, and does not execute any hidden functionality.

This project is released as a **tool for invisible people** — those who care about security, autonomy, and digital minimalism.
